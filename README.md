Yubikey PHP Library
=======================

This library lets you easily interface with the Yubico REST API for validating
the codes created by the Yubikey.

### Requirements:
- An API as requested from the Yubico site
- A client ID requested from Yubico
- A Yubikey to test out the implementation

### Usage:

Look at the `test.php` example script to see how to use it. This can be executed like:

`php test.php [generated key]`
